### Who am I
My name is Zhenlin Wang. I\'m from Ningbo, China. Currently I\'m a master student in the Machine Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon University. My academic interest and work passion lie across the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning/AI and Software Engineering (though they are somewhat connected under the field of Computer Science...). 
<details>
<summary><b>The path to my passion</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>Before university, I was quite obsessed with applying mathematical models to the financial industry. I dreamed of being an equity researcher and predicting flows in the stock and derivatives market. In pursuit of this goal, I read an entire textbook on corporate finance and written all kinds of note on accounting models. However, I was wrong. When I entered the equity research team in the investment club in my university, I quickly realized that people were not "relying" on the models for judgement. They "abuse" these models to fit their assumptions in order to sell their investment plans to customers. This is not what I wanted. So I tried an alternative path - quantitative research. </li>
    <li> Being an applied math student, it\'s fairly easy to imagine that I would be fascinated by the significant amount of math used in quantitative research team in the investment club. This stood up as a completely different track from equity research. I was learning so much data science and machine learning knowledge in this team. I knew I\'ve found my true passion. In the following semester, I enrolled in a second major in Computer Science to learn more about fundamental CS knowledge. I started building up my statistics/data science skills. A youtube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer">StatQuest with Josh Starmer</a> really helped me a lot. Until today, I\'m glad to see it being supported by the community and is still diligently uploding new tutorials on various concepts in stats/DS/ML. </li>
    <li> Further down the path, I started exploring boundaries in some ML sub-fields, namly <i>Bayesian Optimization, Bandit</i> and <i>Reinforcement Learning</i>. I conducted several researches under the guidance of my supervisors, and luckily published some papers. I believe in the motto of <b>Learn to live, Live to learn</b>. No matter how old I am and where I am, I\'ll keep myself challenged with learning new things. At current stage, expanding my passion from theoretical knowledge to real-life application is my major goal. Solving real-world problems with ML breakthroughs require the careful construction of tools and technologies. Thus, learning and practice software engineering has also become part of my life nowadays. </li>  
</ul>

### Looking back
I received my high school and undergradute education in Singapore. It is a second hometown to me. I have no words but only genuine gratitude and respect for this city state. In Singapore, I\'ve met lots of excellent people, learnt countless lessons, and found my true love <i class="fas fa-heart" style="color:red"></i>. My colorful youth life remains in Singapore forever (芳华永驻此狮城~).

### Leisure time
I listen and play musics sometimes. I used to play violin, but nowadays, I prefer harmonica as I can carry it anywhere easily.

I go workout regularly. Since Pittsburgh has lots of tennis court, I\'m planning on playing tennis with my friends as well.

I love eating Thai food and Japanese food, my favorites are Pat Thai, Basil Chicken, Sushi/sashimi and Suki Yaki.

### An ACG Fan
I\'m a Japanese culture lover, specifically it\'s ACG culture and it\'s history. I read manga, watch anime and used to play some galgame. I used to be quite into the anime merchandise <span class="heimu" title="You know too much">(an otaku)</span> but now I just treat it as an interest and watch some old animes for chilling, I\'ll casually write some reviews on animes I watched *again* recently. 

My favorite anime is <b>Steins;Gate</b>. It tells a story of a man leaping through time challenging destiny using a time machine. My favicon is also a tribute to this series. The perseverence of the main protagonist, <i>Okabe Rintarou</i>, motivated me to keep on despite various setbacks from time to time.

This is the end this self-introduction <span class="heimu" title="You know too much">(you call this an intro???)</span>, have fun browsing through my blogs.
