Welcome to my personal website! I\'m Zhenlin Wang. You can call me Criss if it\'s easier for you. I\'m currently studying for a Master of Machine Learning degree in Carnegie Mellon University. Before coming to the US, I completed my undergraduate study at National University of Singapore (NUS). My academic and practical interests lie in the intersection of data science, machine learning and software engineering, and I\'ve been actively seeking for SDE/MLE internships recently. If you are interested to know more about me as a person, you can find some information <a href="/intro">[here]</a>.

## What\'s in my website
This is a space to drop down some notes about my life. I started maintaining this website from my sophomore year in NUS. The original version used a [minimal-mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) style and I\'ve migrated into the [hexo-icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) style on Aug 2022. 

There are several sections in this space:
#### 1. Technical Blogs
Blogs about various topics in DS/AI/ML and software engineering are written here. The mathematical/technical details are presented. I often included some discussion about the pros/cons of the methodologies outlined in these blogs. Nonetheless, I never believe that any blog post can be \"DONE\" as new perspectives on these topics can always supplement what\'s on the posts. Thus, I consistently update these posts whenever I learn some new knowledge about the topics discussed in these posts.

<i><b>Disclaimer: </b>I try my best to give credit for all sources I made referenecs to. If you found some parts in my post that were referenced from your work without credit, please kindly contact me so I can immediately correct my mistakes and make apology.</i>

#### 2. Experience and skill set
My project experiences are listed here for record, many are driven by the interests to explore tech/skills I never knew. I\'m eager to understand the basics of various technology toolkits and learn new stuff along the way.

#### 3. Anime and Enlightenment
These posts will be more of a casual type. 

I watch anime once in a while, especially those classical series that touched me deeply in heart. I\'ve decided to reflect upon reviewing these series and drop them down here.

Sometimes I meditate (<span class="heimu" title="You know too much">(aka. emo)</span>) or read. Now that I think it\'s a good idea to take note of them so that I won\'t waste time repeating myself during my meditations. 

## Special thanks
In retrospect, I did make various references to many websites/blogs when building this version of personal space. I\'ve got to thank [@Lei Mao](https://leimao.github.io/) for the inspiration to build a website from scratch. I followed him since 2018 when I read his background story and found it so motivating. Learning from his blog styles, I built my first version of website and the journey of bloghing started afterwards. When trying to customizing the pages, I learnt so much from [@iMaeGoo](https://www.imaegoo.com/), [@Xinyu Liu](https://www.alphalxy.com/2019/03/customize-icarus/) and [@Pengyuan Li](http://www.pyli.tk/2021/02/03/icarus%E9%BC%93%E6%8D%A3%E5%A4%9C%E9%97%B4%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F/). I should thank them for their great tutorials on website styling.
