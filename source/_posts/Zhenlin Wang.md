I\'m Zhenlin Wang. You can call me Criss as well. I\'m currently an MS student at [Machine Learning Department @ Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). I have a strong passion for machine learning and AI-powered softwares. Recently I\'m drawn to performance optimization of deep learning systems and AI tools. In particular, I\'ve been studying and playing around with distributed systems, MLOps and CUDA-based parallel computing.

Before coming to the US, I completed my undergraduate study at National University of Singapore (NUS). My academic and practical interests lie in the intersection of data science, machine learning and software engineering, and I\'ve been actively seeking for SDE/MLE internships recently. If you are interested to know more about me as a person, you can find some information <a href="/intro">[here]</a>.

## The blog posts

This is a space to drop down some notes about my life. I started maintaining this website from my sophomore year in NUS. The original version used a [minimal-mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) style and I\'ve migrated into the [hexo-icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) style on Aug 2022.

Blogs here covers various topics in DS/AI/ML and software engineering are written here. The mathematical/technical details are presented. I often included some discussion about the pros/cons of the methodologies outlined in these blogs. Nonetheless, I never believe that any blog post can be \"DONE\" as new perspectives on these topics can always supplement what\'s on the posts. Thus, I consistently update these posts whenever I learn some new knowledge about the topics discussed in these posts.

## Special thanks

In retrospect, I have to thank [@Lei Mao](https://leimao.github.io/) for the inspiration to build a website from scratch. I followed him since 2018 when I read his motivating background story. When trying to customizing the pages, I learnt from [@iMaeGoo](https://www.imaegoo.com/), [@Xinyu Liu](https://www.alphalxy.com/2019/03/customize-icarus/) and [@Pengyuan Li](http://www.pyli.tk/2021/02/03/icarus%E9%BC%93%E6%8D%A3%E5%A4%9C%E9%97%B4%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F/), and I thank them for their great tutorials on website styling.
