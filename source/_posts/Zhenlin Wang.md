## About Me

I\'m Zhenlin Wang. You can call me Criss as well. I\'m currently an MS student at <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[Machine Learning Department @ Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/)</ins>. I have a strong passion for machine learning and AI-powered softwares. Recently I\'m drawn to performance optimization of deep learning systems and AI tools. In particular, I\'ve been studying and playing around with distributed systems, MLOps and CUDA-based parallel computing.

Before coming to the US, I graduate with First Class Honor from <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/)</ins> with a B.S. double major in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. There I was fortunate enough to work with Prof. <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/)</ins> and <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/lowkh/)</ins> on multi-arm bandit, bayesian optimization and high-dimensional statistics. I also worked with Prof. <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html)</ins> and his Phd <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[Andrew Wagenmaker](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ajwagen/index.html)</ins> on bandit and Reinforcement Learning problems.

Engineering is an integral part of my life since my 15. I built an event-driven signal generation system at <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[J.P. Morgan Securities LLC](https://www.jpmorgan.com/securities-services)</ins> for its securitzed product trading using Python and C++. I also led the design, implementation, deployment and monitoring of an ML-based price suggestion tool for <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[eyos.one](https://eyos.one/)</ins> an IT-startup based in Singapore. At NUS, I\'ve collaborated with <ins style="font-weight: 600;">[MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation](https://moht.com.sg/)</ins> to develop Schizophrenia relapses forecasting models with ML workflow covering data prep, model experimentation, finetuning, artifact storage, inference service implemenetation and orchestration and distributed deployment.

## About the blogs

I started maintaining this website from my sophomore year in NUS. The original version used a [minimal-mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) style and I\'ve migrated into the [hexo-icarus](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) style on Aug 2022.

The blogs here covers various topics in DS/AI/ML and software engineering are written here. The mathematical/technical details are presented. I often included some discussion about the pros/cons of the methodologies outlined in these blogs. Nonetheless, I don\'t think that any blog post can be mark \"DONE\" as new perspectives on these topics can always supplement what\'s on the posts. Thus, I consistently update these posts whenever I learn some new knowledge about the topics discussed in these posts.

<i><b>Disclaimer: </b>I try my best to give credit for all sources I made referenecs to. If you found some parts in my post that were referenced from your work without credit, please kindly contact me so I can immediately correct my mistakes and make apology.</i>

## Special thanks

In retrospect, I have to thank [@Lei Mao](https://leimao.github.io/) for the inspiration to build a website from scratch. I followed him since 2018 when I read his motivating background story. When trying to customizing the pages, I learnt from [@iMaeGoo](https://www.imaegoo.com/), [@Xinyu Liu](https://www.alphalxy.com/2019/03/customize-icarus/) and [@Pengyuan Li](http://www.pyli.tk/2021/02/03/icarus%E9%BC%93%E6%8D%A3%E5%A4%9C%E9%97%B4%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F/), and I thank them for their great tutorials on website styling.
