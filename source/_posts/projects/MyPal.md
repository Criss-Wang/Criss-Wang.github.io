### Introduction
[MyPal](https://github.com/Criss-Wang/MyPal-App) is a web application for students in campus to manage the interpersonal connections online. It was built by me and Ren Hao from National University of Singapore (who is now also my school mate at CMU). Our initiative for building this app was to give college students the power to conveniently create, manage and safely store important details about the people they want to keep connected with in their ever-expanding social circle during their college life. 

### Tech stack
Our app used MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, ReactJS, Node.js) for development. 

### Major features
1. **\"Relationship Info\" creation template**
  - Template to create a new info sheet about a person in one\'s social network
  - Can be personlized by adding and removing elements in the template

2. **Categorization and tagging**
  - Allow tags and categories to be applied on each connection for fast group viewing and relationship management
  - Associate links to enable the user to switch to the social media to message a specific person
3. **Social Network Visualization**
