### **Introduction**

[CLI-nic](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp) is an application to help medical supply managers keep track of medical products and storage. It is optimized for these managers to update product supply conditions and access critical product information quickly via fast typing and efficient Graphical User Interface interaction.

It is my [CS2103 Software Engineering](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/website/) project. I collaborated with [Chan Qin Liang](https://github.com/qlchan24), [Jeffrey Tan Jian Sheng](http://github.com/jeffreytjs), [Lim Zheng Wei](http://github.com/zhengweii) and [Toh Yu Ting](https://github.com/tohyuting) in an Agile style. We managed to build this app within 3 months with a sprint of 3 weeks. In addition to the app itself, we produced an extensive [documentation](https://ay2021s1-cs2103-w14-4.github.io/tp/) (developer\'s guide and user\'s guide) for our app utilizing UML diagrams significantly.
