## Intro to the spark of thought
A few days ago, I started reading a book called \"Nonviolent Communication\". It shocked me as I discovered many of my daily communication practices were actually the opposite of what\'s been suggested by this book. I feel offended initially, but quickly realized the book was right about the consequences I faced when my way of talking went against its suggestions. Afterwards, I moved on and learned much from this book. I have to admit, it is an excellent teacher to me.
