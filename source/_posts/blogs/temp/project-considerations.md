Note: Before making design decisions as in the other [blogpost](http://localhost:4000/post/blogs/deep-learning-system-design/), you should have high level system overview and respective goals in mind, they are as follows:

## High level overview

### 5 Components

    - Data
    - Algorithm
    - Infrastructure
    - Interface
    - Hardware

### Major concerns when shifting from research to production

    1. Objectives
    2. Computational priority
    3. data
    4. fairness
    5. interpretability

### Requirements for MLsys

    1. Scalable
    2. Maintainability
    3. Adaptability
    4. Reliability
    5. Tracability

Figure out project details

1. Goals
2. User Experience
3. Performance constraints
4. Evaluation
5. Personalization
6. Project Constraints
