In early 2000s, if a kid in China claims that he loves anime, he will definitely be laughed at by adults. Watching anime, reading comic or playing video games were often treated as \"boring\" interests for children who cannot go out and make friends. Parents would persuade their anime-loving children to go play sports or hang out with friends instead of starring at TV or computer screens. \"These are childish cartoons. You should stop watching them and grow up!\", my father used to say this to me when I was 7. Because of the social prejudice on ACG culture as a symbol for immaturity, I always found it awkward to bring this hobby up when chatting with my friends or my relatives. A few years later, I learned from my friends in the US that the same situation happened there as well (and the situation seems to be unchanged till today). People were called \"weebs\" or \"otaku\" and were made fun of by other children. However, I was truly passionate about the ACG culture, and firmly believed in the change of social consensus about it.

I was lucky to see the change happening in recent years. With a growing power of social media, more and more ACG lovers started to inform others of the true nature of ACG. It was really about people using animated drawing to tell great stories, praise humanity and inculcate ethics and good moral principles. As the community began to appreciate the value of ACG culture, a large influx of new ACG lovers surged, and business surrounding ACG cultures started to become profitable. Bilibili, the largest video streaming service provider in China today, was founded by a group of ACG lovers with the intention to make anime, comic and game videos more available to all ACG fans. Some popular animes have received over billions of viewership on this platform.

People are no longer discriminating against ACG lovers nowadays. The ACG community finally gets recognized by parents, educators and even captial. Tons of commerical advertisements actually used anime characters to attract customers. Some live shows even integrate ACG into their themes. In the meantime, great animes kept popping up, further blowing our mind and getting our hearts touched. Even in the US, fantastic animations like \"Rick and Morty\" have amazed ACG lovers through their storyline and characters. I am so happy that this industry survived and even thrived.

There are just too many great anime to talk about. Many inspired me, touched me and motivated me deeply. The weeb today can confidently claim himself an ACG fan in the public without feeling awkward anymore. I want to leave my memory here in my log book space. I will talk about these great anime series, sharing my feelings with all of you. It will an adventure to the past, present and future.
