- I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (Double Major) at National University of Singapore.
- During my four years of study and research life, I was fortunate to work with a bunch of brilliant minds, [Prof. Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/). and [Prof. Bryan Low Kian Hsiang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html)
- During the last Summer, I worked as a student intern at University of Washington with [Prof. Kevin Jamieson](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html) and his Phd student [Andrew Wagenmaker](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ajwagen/index.html) on a Multi-arm Bandit research.

## Research Interests
My Research Interests lie in Statistical Learning Theories of Machine Learning and various Sequantial Decision-Making Models under uncertainties. I strive to develop probabilistic machine learning methods with robustness, replicability and theoretical guarantees. My recent research projects have had a focus on bandit problems, Gaussian Process and Bayesian Optimization. It's a field full of wonder and pontetial, and I keep learning new ideas every day!

## Fun Facts
- I enjoy Thai food a lot, especially its Mango sticky rice.
- I'm a big fan of Japanese history and culture. I also like its dramas, TV shows and anime. I'm currently learning Japanese as well.
- I used to play harmonica and violin. But in this day of Covid crisis, I could only stay home, so I restricted myself from playing them so as to not annoy my tenant friends. Instead, I started to appreciate classical music and modern classicals. I'm a big fan of *Ludovico Einaudi* recently. Listening to his pieces is soooo relaxing!
