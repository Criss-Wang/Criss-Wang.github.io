# Overview

## 1. Definition
A database is a collection of information that is usually stored in computer systems. The information are usually data of various forms. The main function of database is for the managers of these information to better store and manipulate the data efficiently. 

A database can be either relational or non-relational.

## 2. Relational database
In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a "unique ID" called the __key__. The columns of the table hold attribute of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

## 3. Non-relational database
A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. For example, data may be stored as simple key/value pairs, as JSON documents, or as a graph consisting of edges and vertices.[^1]
